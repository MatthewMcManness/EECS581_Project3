Program Title: BusyBee
Program Description: 
    The app will feature a modern and clean design, similar to popular productivity apps, with a bottom navigation bar to easily switch between the calendar 
and to-do list views. The Calendar section will display a grid for the current month, allowing users to view and interact with each day, while the To-Do List section will
 provide a scrollable list of tasks with the ability to add, check, and remove tasks. The user interface is built with KivyMD's material design components, providing a sleek 
 and responsive look that fits perfectly on mobile devices.

	Utilizing Kivy and KivyMD ensures cross-platform compatibility and a professional, mobile-optimized experience. Kivy’s layout flexibility makes it ideal for creating responsive
designs that adapt to different screen sizes, while KivyMD’s material design elements provide a polished and user-friendly interface. The bottom navigation bar and scrollable 
layouts for both calendar and to-do list views will offer an intuitive experience for users. This approach allows for easy expansion with future features, such as adding events
 or task notifications, ensuring the app is scalable and future-ready.
